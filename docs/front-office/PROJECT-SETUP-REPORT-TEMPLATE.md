PROJECT_SETUP_REPORT (Template)

Purpose
- This is the “meta layer” output for a project.
- It makes setup non-rigid: we keep the backbone, then adapt agents/skills/docs/tasks to the business.
- It should be short, decisive, and actionable.

1) Project snapshot
- Name:
- Type profile (pick one): Consulting outreach | E-commerce/Shopify | Content/YouTube | SaaS/Engineering | Personal CRM/Network/Jobs
- One-line mission:
- Success criteria (1–3 bullets):
- Constraints (timeline/budget/tools/compliance):
- Approval policy (defaults):
  - External actions (sending outreach, publishing, spending, account changes) require explicit approval.

2) Agent roster (who exists + why)
Defaults (always)
- Research agent
  - Owns: knowledge ingestion, source summarization, skills + specialization scan
- PM agent
  - Owns: task hygiene, check-ins, escalation, war room summaries

Execution (choose 1–2)
- Builder agent
- QA/Verifier agent
- Outreach agent (consulting)
- Shopify Operator (ecom)
- Social Researcher (content)

Specializations (only if needed)
- (List)

3) Skills/tools recommendations (max 3)
For each:
- Skill/tool:
- What it unlocks:
- Setup steps:
- Risks/approvals:

4) Starter docs required (beyond the baseline)
Baseline docs (always)
- Project overview, requirements/spec, decisions, runbook

Additional docs (this project)
- (List the 1–4 extra docs that truly matter)

5) First 10 tasks (create + assign)
Setup (3)
- Verify Drive spine + links
- Verify knowledge ingest/search
- Agent comms smoke (each agent posts a task update)

Execution (5)
- (Project-specific tasks)

Verification (2)
- Smoke test / end-to-end check
- Review approval rules + risks

6) System map (text)
- War room: what gets posted there
- Where artifacts go: Drive folders
- Where progress goes: task timeline

7) Known risks + what we’ll watch
- Risk:
- Early warning signal:
- Mitigation:

8) Next operator decisions
- (What Zack needs to approve/answer to unblock progress)
