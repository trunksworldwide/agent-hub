Business Profiles (Front Office)

Purpose
- We don’t want one rigid template.
- We do want a consistent backbone.
- These profiles tell Trunks/PM/Research what to optimize for by default.

Backbone (always)
- Agents: Research + PM
- Drive spine + CAPABILITIES doc
- Knowledge ingest + search
- Task timeline updates (task_events)
- Approval policy for external actions

Profile A — Consulting Outreach (default-first)
Optimize for: speed to pipeline + learning
Special agents (usually)
- Outreach agent (drafts sequences + targets; never sends without approval)
- Case Study/Collateral agent
Key starter docs
- ICP + positioning
- Offer + pricing hypothesis
- Outreach sequences (email/DM)
- Lead list criteria + sources
Key automations
- Daily: pipeline health brief (drafts + targets + blockers)
- Weekly: sequence iteration report

Profile B — E-commerce / Shopify
Optimize for: conversion + merchandising
Special agents (sometimes)
- Shopify Operator agent (browser automation)
- Product Research agent
Key starter docs
- Catalog + pricing assumptions
- Competitor scan
- Landing page + PDP checklist
Key automations
- Daily: conversion blockers + test ideas

Profile C — Content / YouTube
Optimize for: research → ideas → production
Special agents (often)
- Social Researcher (X/Twitter + web)
- Producer (briefs + outlines)
Key starter docs
- Audience + format
- Idea pipeline rules (dedupe)
- Publishing cadence
Key skills/tools
- X/Twitter research pipeline (cheap->expensive fallback)

Profile D — SaaS / Engineering
Optimize for: correctness + shipping safely
Special agents (often)
- DevOps agent
- Security/Review agent
Key starter docs
- Architecture sketch
- API contract
- Test plan
- Runbook

Profile E — Personal CRM / Network / Jobs
Optimize for: recall + follow-up automation
Special agents (often)
- CRM Ingest agent (email/calendar)
- Follow-up agent (drafts + reminders)
Key starter docs
- Contact scoring rules
- Exclusions + filters
- Follow-up cadence
Key storage
- Structured DB + semantic search

How to choose
- If unsure, start with Consulting Outreach.
Why:
- Fast feedback loops.
- Minimal external dependencies.
- Produces clear artifacts (ICP, sequences, target list) that prove the system works.

Then branch into E-commerce or Content once the backbone is stable.
