Agent Spawn Checklist (for adding an agent weeks/months into a project)

Purpose
- Covers the “late add” use case: a project is already running and we want to introduce a new agent without chaos.

Step 1 — Confirm why we need a new agent
- What is missing today?
- Is this a role gap (ownership) or a task gap (just assign tasks to an existing agent)?
- If it is temporary work: prefer a single task assigned to an existing agent.

Step 2 — Pull the current project context
- Read the Project Mission + Overview
- Read CAPABILITIES (endpoints + rules)
- Scan top 5 active tasks + their latest events
- Scan war room for the last 50 messages

Step 3 — Define the agent role (light but clear)
Use AGENT-BRIEF-TEMPLATE.md:
- Purpose (1–3 sentences)
- Responsibilities (3–6 bullets)
- Non-goals (2–5 bullets)
- Decision latitude + approvals

Step 4 — Decide tools/skills
- List the default tools (knowledge + drive + tasks + agent-browser)
- If this agent needs special tools:
  - create a task: “Skills/setup needed for <agent role>”
  - Trunks installs/configures (agents do not install tools)

Step 5 — Provision the agent
- Provision agent in the project
- Ensure SOUL includes “How to Operate Mission Control”
- Ensure the agent knows the approval rules

Step 6 — Update the project system map
- Add the new agent to the project’s org chart (text)
- Note what it owns and what it will report on

Step 7 — Give the agent a clean first task
- Create one onboarding task:
  - “Onboard: read context + propose next actions”
- Require one update in the task thread within 30 minutes.

Step 8 — Verify the agent is alive
- Confirm the heartbeat/tick schedule is set (default 30m)
- Confirm it posts at least one task update

Done criteria
- Agent is provisioned
- Agent posted at least one task-thread update
- Agent’s first work product is uploaded to Drive and linked
- PM agent acknowledges the new agent in war room and updates assignments
