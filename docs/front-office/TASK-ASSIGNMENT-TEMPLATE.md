Task Assignment Template (Front Office)

Use this whenever Zack says: “Tell agent X to do Y.”
Goal: enough clarity to move fast, but not so rigid it kills autonomy.

1) Task summary
- Title (one sentence):
- Why it matters (one sentence):

2) Context to include (minimum)
- Project mission (1 line):
- Relevant docs/links (0–5):
- Constraints (deadline, budget, do-not-touch list):

3) Expected outcome (not a script)
Pick ONE:
- Draft (copy, plan, sequence, spec)
- Recommendation (options + tradeoffs + what you’d do)
- Shipped change (code/config) + proof it works
- Research brief (sources + key findings)

4) Progress + reporting rules (always)
- First update in task thread within 30 minutes of starting.
- Then update when something changes (milestone, question, blocker, done).
- Upload any meaningful artifact to Drive and link it.

5) Approval rule reminder
- If this involves external side effects, stop and ask for approval.

6) If blocked
- Post an UNBLOCK comment with exactly what’s missing and 1–2 options.

7) Optional (only if useful)
- Quality bar: “good enough” vs “high polish”
- Output format: bullets / doc / spreadsheet / slide outline
